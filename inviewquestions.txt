1)which XPATH is prefered? why?
    relative XPATH becoz
    1)if developer introduced new element then absolute XPATH will be broken
    2)if developer changed the location then XPATH will not work
2)diffrence bw close and quit
	close -- will close single browser command (driver.get)
	quit -- will close multiple browser window --killing the entire process of chrome driver 
3)find_element vs find_elements
find_element-returns single webelement
------------
	1)locator matching with single webelement
	2)locator matching with multiple webelement
	3)element not available then throw 'no such element exception'if the path is incorrect

find_elements-returns multiple webelement
-------------
	1)locator matching with single webelement as a list ex:[1,2,3]
	2)locator matching with multiple webelementas a list
	3)if element not available it does not throw 'no such element exception'it cosider as a emptylist

wait commands -to overcome the synchronization problem
-------------
time.sleep(sec)-from the python 
	The disadvantage is
    1)performance of the script become very poor 
 	2)if the element is not avaliable within the time mentioned,there is a chance of getting exception.

1)implicitly_wait (10)
----------------------
--it is recomended to write in the begining of the script(under the chrome driver) which will perform all over the script 
--This kill byitself if the element found before the time mentioned
